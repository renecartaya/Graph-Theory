# Pathfinding using Graph-Theory

The current repository aims to implement Graph-theory for pathfinding algorithms.  Graph theory has applications that include:

 1) Performance optimization of CNC systems
 2) Industrial process optimization
 3) Pathfinding in transport processes
 4) Chemical processes

This project is developed mainly on Python and aims to be enhanced using Machine Learning algorithms. Some examples of implementations of pathfinding in the industrial process include air ticket selections, available in the repository.

## Example

The current example represent an abstraction for resembling of the use of graph theory for applications as above mentioned.

## Observation

The project under development is aimed for applications in the optimization of optical inspection and metrology applications. However, the system could cover another applications like the previous mentioned.
