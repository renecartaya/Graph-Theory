# Pathfinding using Graph-Theory

The current repository aims to implement Graph-theory for pathfinding algorithms. Graph theory has applications that include:

 1) Performance Optimization of CNC systems
 2) Chemical phenomena
 3) The choice of tickets for transport from point A to point B combining different transport systems

This project is developed mainly on Python and aims to be enhanced using Machine Learning algorithms. Some examples of implementations of pathfinding in the industrial process include air ticket selections, available in the repository.
