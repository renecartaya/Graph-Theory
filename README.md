# Pathfinding using Graph-Theory

The current repository is aimed to implement Graph-theory for pathfinding algorithms. This could result in different applications that could include:

 1) Chemical phenomenas.
 2) The choice of tickets for transport from point A to point B combining different transport systems as:
    - Walking.
    - Bike.
    - Car driving.
    - Motorcycle driving.
    - Airplane.
    - Ships.
    
 3) Preventive and predictive maintenance planning.
  

This project is developed mainly on Python and is projected to be enhanced using Machine Learning algorithms.
